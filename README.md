![enemy battle](/img/projectimages/IMG_0334.jpg)

Battles will incorporate an enemy AI that will battle you. Enemies will be stored in objects and will have an elemental type. Battles will play out until either the player or the enemy's hp is 0. 

Damage will be determined by (math.random). Each ability button will run a function that attacks the enemy with chosen element type.

Pokemon inspired battle type. Maybe a text box pops up that says "Not very effective" or "Super Effective!"

## Victory!

Victory screen will make the ability buttons inaccessible. The enemy's sprite will change to a death sprite. Bonus will be to add loot at battles end such as potions.

## Death!

Sometimes we lose. If the player loses the wizard sprite will turn to a death one. You died! will appear on the screen with a retry button somewhere neard it. Ability buttons will no longer be accessible. 

## Final Victory Screen

   The wizard walks off into the distance. Some text will appear at the top of the screen in a box. This will occur after 3 enemy battles.
